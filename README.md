How long is the coast of La Isla de los Alacranes?

## Processing workaround

This project is built using Processing, a graphics library built on Java.
The famous paradox "How Long is the Coast of Britain?", elaborated by Benoit Mandelbrot, is shown in action through Processing.
The paradox is adapted to La Isla de los Alacranes, an small island in Chapala Lake (Jalisco, Mexico).
The island coast, known as the origin of humankind according to the ancient Huicholes, is demonstrated to be infinite long as Britain one.

To run this project, clone it and open with Processing (follow all the steps to install Processing from processing.org).

Enjoy!
